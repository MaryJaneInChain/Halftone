# TODO:
- [ ] Add preview on/off switch
- [ ] Show how smaller the file is after dithering
- [ ] Implement more dithering algorithms
- [ ] Replace color amount selector with predefined custom palettes
- [ ] Switch to different UI design ([Paleta](https://github.com/nate-xyz/paleta) seems like a good candidate)

### Issues:
- [ ] When opening image in dither page, the options used on previous image won't be applied on loaded image preview (lack of options retention mechanism)
