# TODO:
- [ ] Add preview on/off switch
- [ ] Show how smaller the file is after dithering
- [ ] Implement more dithering algorithms (issue #28)
- [ ] Replace color amount selector with predefined custom palettes (also issue #28)
- [x] Switch to different UI design ([Paleta](https://github.com/nate-xyz/paleta) seems like a good candidate)
- [ ] Add spring animation for hiding bottom sheet
- [ ] Add scroll and touch drag gestures for triggering bottom sheet hide animation

### Issues:
- [ ] When opening image in dither page, the options used on previous image won't be applied on loaded image preview (lack of options retention mechanism)
